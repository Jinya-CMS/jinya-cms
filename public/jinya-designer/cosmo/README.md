# Cosmo CSS by Jinya

## What is Cosmo CSS

Cosmo CSS is a small CSS library that gives you the ability to style your applications following the cosmopolitan design
guidelines.
These guidelines were developed by Microsoft as theme for Silverlight. Later they were adapted by the Zune desktop
software and were implemented in the .net
framework ["Modern UI for WPF (MUI)"](https://github.com/firstfloorsoftware/mui).

The Cosmopolitan design was always looking good and quite easy to use. With Jinya CMS version 18.0.0 the CMS got a new
polished administration based on this CSS library.

## How to install

You can either just drop the CSS files in your project or install the npm package `@jinyacms/cosmo`.
